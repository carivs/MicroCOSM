# MicroCOSM
This repository includes the codebase and documentation for MicroCOSM (Microsimulation for the Control of South African Morbidity and Mortality)

Until further notice, the codebase included here is not the most recent version of MicroCOSM and can only be used for the simulation of HIV, HPV and cervical cancer in South Africa. 
Documentation still to be added.

File types:
* Microsimulation.cpp and .h are the main code files for the model.
* Other C++ files (not my code) contain functions for the random number generator and statistical distributions. 
* *RandomUniformHPV.txt files numbered from 1-100 contain random numbers that generate the best fitting parameter combinations.
* Other txt files contain epidemiodemiological data and fixed parameters.
